# Matplotlib-Treatment-Analysis

In this sample study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated with a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. I was tasked with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study as well as summary of the study results.

First I cleaned the data and removed duplicate entries, then generated summary statistics, created bar charts and pie charts, calculated quartiles, found outliers, and created a box plot. I also created a line plot and a scatter plot to display treatment of one example mouse, along with correlation and regression of one of the treatments. I included some observations at the top of the notebook as well.
