In this project, I analyzed data regarding drug treatments for tumors in mice. First I cleaned the data and removed duplicate entries, then generated summary statistics, created bar charts and pie charts, calculated quartiles, found outliers, and created a box plot. I also created a line plot and a scatter plot to display treatment of one example mouse, along with correlation and regression of one of the treatments. I included some observations at the top of the notebook as well.
